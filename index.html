   Hello page visitors.  This is my page. I am making it to learn HTML & CSS.

    <br>
    I was born in 1986 to Dane and Bertha Moseson.  I was born in a very small town called Longview, Washington.  I have two older sisters, Heidi and Erika.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Growing up, we lived in Longview in a big house right across from Lake Sacagawea.  We were separated from the lake by a big highway called Ocean Beach Highway.  This meant everytime we mowed the lawn, took our dog out, washed the car, or otherwise left the house, there was a good chance that someone we knew would drive by and see us.
